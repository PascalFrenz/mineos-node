Please Note
======

I am currently rewriting the code to leverage TypeScript and modern Angular, but the original repository
by [William Dizon](https://github.com/hexparrot) can be found [here](https://github.com/hexparrot/mineos-node).
It is still actively maintained and is generally an amazing piece of software, so go check it out :)

Node.JS MineOS
======

MineOS is a server front-end to ease managing Minecraft administrative tasks.
This iteration using Node.js aims to enhance previous MineOS scripts (Python-based),
by leveraging the event-triggering, asyncronous model of Node.JS and websockets.

This allows the front-end to provide system health, disk and memory usage, and logging in real-time.


Developing and Contributing
------

I'd love to get contributions from you, especially during the rewrite. Currently, TypeScript and Angular are in use,
in addition to some bash scripts and other linux-related config files.
Feel free to reach out to me, and we will see how you can contribute your efforts effectively.

Support
-------

Because of the rewrite, I cannot provide proper support.
Once the project reaches a stable state and can be used in production environments, support will be provided.
